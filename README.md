#### Project Description:

<p>
Magic X Logic is an ambitious project that aims to create a universe of its own inspired by the structure of Marvel or DC, but with a magical setting. This project will take years to complete. The main idea is to take advantage of all my knowledge to give it visibility and improve its reach, and I think the website will be a key tool to achieve this. My priority is to learn how to develop a high-quality website so that, in the future (hopefully not too far away!), this project can scale significantly.
